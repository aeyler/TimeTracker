# TimeTracker
Summary:

Waktu is going away. Toggl exists, but I want to use this as an opportunity to learn to make a basic web app (a "hello world" if you will)

To that end I plan/hope to accomplish the following:
- Be able to set up time items for projects
- Select which project I am currently working on and store the time
- Save time data
- Get a list of projects and times spend on them at the end of the week

And yes, at the end, I may go back to using Toggl, but I want to give this a learning shot first.
